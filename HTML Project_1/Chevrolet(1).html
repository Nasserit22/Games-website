                Valorant (stylized as VALORANT) is a free-to-play first-person hero shooter developed and published by Riot Games, for Microsoft Windows. First teased under the codename Project A in October 2019, the game began a closed beta period with limited access on April 7, 2020, followed by an official release on June 2, 2020. The development of the game started in 2014. Valorant takes inspiration from the Counter-Strike series of tactical shooters, borrowing several mechanics such as the buy menu, spray patterns, and inaccuracy while moving.

                Valorant is a team-based first-person hero shooter set in the near future. Players play as one of a set of Agents, characters designed based on several countries and cultures around the world. In the main game mode, players are assigned to either the attacking or defending team with each team having five players on it. Agents have unique abilities, each requiring charges, as well as a unique ultimate ability that requires charging through kills, deaths, orbs, or objectives. Every player starts each round with a "classic" pistol and one or more "signature ability" charges. Other weapons and ability charges can be purchased using an in-game economic system that awards money based on the outcome of the previous round, any kills the player is responsible for, and any objectives completed. The game has an assortment of weapons including secondary guns like sidearms and primary guns like submachine guns, shotguns, machine guns, assault rifles and sniper rifles. There are automatic and semi-automatic weapons that each have a unique shooting pattern that has to be controlled by the player to be able to shoot accurately. It currently offers 19 agents to choose from. They are Brimstone, Viper, Omen, Cypher, Sova, Sage, Phoenix, Jett, Raze, Breach, Reyna, Killjoy, Skye, Yoru, Astra, KAY/O, Chamber, Neon, and Fade.

                PHOENIX. Phoenix is one of the most self-sufficient agents on the roster. He's a fiery (literally) Londoner who controls various flame abilities. Like Viper, he can put up a wall which prevents enemies' sight lines, and like Brimstone he's got a Molotov. Phoenix is a dark skinned, youthful tall man of Afro-British descent who wears a black long sleeve shirt with a white Phoenix graphic underneath his white jacket.

                    Reyna is considered by many as the strongest Duelist in Valorant because of her self-sufficient abilities. While on the surface, Reyna's abilities can look weak, it is unbelievably overpowered in-game if you're able to easily secure kills. Reyna's codename was Vampire in development, and that appears to still be relevant: Her lines in the video include "Give me your heart," "More, more," and "All dead, and I'm still hungry." She's rocking a pretty nice purple-and-black color scheme.

                    Born from the eternal winter of Russia's tundra, Sova tracks, finds, and eliminates enemies with ruthless efficiency and precision. His custom bow and incredible scouting abilities ensure that even if you run, you cannot hide. Sova was a female during some stage in the development of VALORANT, with the name Andressa 'Hunter' Dias. Literally translated, Sova, or сова, means owl. Owls are silently but deadly predators; Sova is a hunter who stops at nothing.

                        Jett is easily the best duelist in VALORANT, providing incredible value when used correctly. Players can outmaneuver opponents with ease, escaping danger or positioning themselves for easy kills. Jett is a fair-skinned, short girl, being the smallest of the VALORANT agents prior to Neon's addition. She has white hair, which she ties in a bun on the back. Her bangs are rather long and remain stably locked.
