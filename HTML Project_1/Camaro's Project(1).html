                The Chevrolet Camaro is a mid-size American automobile manufactured by Chevrolet, classified as a pony car.It first went on sale on September 29, 1966, for the 1967 model year and was designed as a competing model to the Ford Mustang. The Camaro shared its platform and major components with the Firebird, produced by Chevy's sister division Pontiac, also introduced for 1967.

                Heading into Chevrolet model year 1968, the overall high-performance world was pegging its collective rev limiter, so to speak. Chevrolet drag racing records were by and far number one, as were the huge amount of enthusiastic Chevrolet fans and followers. How so? Think back to all the great models and engines produced since late 1954. To be sure, for all those who were there, this was the greatest 15 years of Chevrolet performance cars. It was evident the Bow Tie brigade wasn't about to slow down any time soon.

                    The 1963 Sting Ray production car's lineage can be traced to two separate GM projects: the Q-Corvette, and Bill Mitchell's racing Sting Ray. The Q-Corvette exercise of 1957 envisioned a smaller, more advanced Corvette as a coupe-only model, boasting a rear transaxle, independent rear suspension, and four-wheel disc brakes, with the rear brakes mounted inboard. Exterior styling was purposeful, with peaked fenders, a long nose, and a short, bobbed tail.

                    Chevrolet debuted the full-size Super Sport Impala in 1961. Only 453 cars were optioned with the SS package that included SS logos on the side moldings and the trunk lid, a 'Corvette-style' passenger grab-bar and suspension/brake upgrades. The current owner purchased this '61 Impala 'Bubbletop' in 2008. He is only the third owner and states that it is an authentic Super Sport with actual mileage of just over 25,000. The retro-Chevy was restored with comprehensive mechanical upgrades by CMX Customs, Summerville, SC (2010).

                        The glory days of the Chevy Corvette have generally coincided with the availability of an alphanumeric soup of engine and equipment packages. Go back to the 1960s and early ’70s, and all sorts of near mythical combinations show up, with the LT1, L88, LS6, ZR-1, and Z06 being the most notable. Contrast that with the Vette’s Dark Ages between the OPEC oil crisis and the introduction of the fourth-generation Corvette, the C4, in 1984, when the options lists were limited to some slightly more powerful engines and sportier suspensions.
