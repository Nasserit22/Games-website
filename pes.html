        <p class="about_info">ABOUT:<br> PES 2020 (eFootball Pro Evolution Soccer 2020) is a football simulation video game developed by PES Productions and published by Konami for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Android, and IOS.[1] The game is the 19th installment in the eFootball Pro Evolution Soccer series and was launched worldwide on 10 September 2019 and in Japan on 12 September 2019.

            This year's edition features a name change with the addition of 'eFootball' within the title, symbolising a push in the online gaming space with a focus on eFootball Pro tournaments. Lionel Messi returned as the cover star of the standard edition, which was the first since his last appearance on the cover of Pro Evolution Soccer 2011, alongside PES ambassadors Serge Gnabry, Miralem Pjanić and Scott McTominay, each representing one of the game's partner clubs.[2] Ronaldinho was featured on the cover of the legend edition.[2] PES 2020 is the last game in the series to use Kojima Productions's Fox Engine. It is also the last installment in the franchise to use the PES name and branding as the following installment was just named eFootball 2022 and is free to play.[3][4]
            
            The mobile version reached 300 million downloads by June 2020</p>

            <p class="about">Nineteen leagues are fully licensed in the game. All the teams in these leagues feature real players, kits and logos, although a minority of the players in the Brazilian leagues still appear with generic names.[16] Three new league licenses were obtained: the Italian Serie A, Italian Serie B (unlicensed at launch), and the Brazilian Campeonato Brasileiro Série B.[17][16]

                Konami have retained the license for the AFC Champions League, remaining in the game since its introduction in PES 2014.[16] With this, debutants for 2019 AFC Champions League, Gyeongnam, Al Zawraa, Daegu and Johor Darul Ta'zim also appear for the first time in this franchise.
                
                The English Premier League (with the exceptions of Manchester United and Arsenal), EFL Championship, Spanish La Liga (except for Barcelona and Mallorca) and Segunda División will appear as unlicensed leagues in the game. These leagues will, however, feature real players.[16] Serie A have all clubs licensed, except Brescia.
                
                Thai League 1 and Chinese Super League are also included.[18]</p>
